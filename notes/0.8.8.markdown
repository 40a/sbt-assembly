### breaking: jarName is now a task

Good news for those who wants to generate jar name dynamically. Thanks to [@dchenbecker][@dchenbecker], `jarName in assembly` is now a task [#74][74].

### quieter output

Previously sbt-assemlby displayed info-level log message every time it resolved file conflicts (some people include jars into jars). For most of the files, the conflicts are merged by default using a strategy called 'deduplicate', which allows duplicates as long as the *content* of the file is identical. In some projects reportedly it fills up 50,000 lines of "Merging xyz" log according to [@hrjet][@hrjet] in [#76][76].

sbt-assembly 0.8.8 will now demote 'deduplicate' logs to debug-level, and promote all other strategies to warning-level. It will also display a summary at the end:

    [warn] Merging 'README' with strategy 'rename'
    [warn] Merging 'LICENSE' with strategy 'rename'
    [warn] Merging 'META-INF/MANIFEST.MF' with strategy 'discard'
    [info] Strategy 'deduplicate' was applied to a file (Run the task at debug level to see details)
    [warn] Strategy 'discard' was applied to a file
    [warn] Strategy 'rename' was applied to 2 files
